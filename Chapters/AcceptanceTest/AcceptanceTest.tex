\chapter{Acceptance Test}\label{cha:AcceptTest}

The system has been described and explained through the prototype and the modelling, to be able to understand the functionalities needed. The controllers have been implemented for the functions needed, according to the sensors used. For the last part of the project, tests of the different parts of the system and the system as a whole, will ensure that the system can handle the requirements determined in \secref{Requirements}.
