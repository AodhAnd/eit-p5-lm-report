           1    &   The received coordinates from the GoT system is compared to the log file from the GoT system, shown in \tableref{}. All the coordinates is equal to the coordinates measured and send from the GoT and the coordinates have be received correctly.    &   Yes               \\
\hline%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           2    &   The packages, including the error packages, that the GoT system send, is received by the Arduino, where the error handling parts of the protocol filter all the error packages away, shown in \tableref{}.   &  Yes                \\
\hline%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           3    &   The speed between the positions, measured by the GoT system is shown on \figref {}, where the packages send to the Arduino is green and those that is not send is red. All positions, that have moved away faster than 3 $m \cdot s^{-1}$ is not send.   &  Yes            \\
\hline%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           4    &   Test not made   &   No                \\

           5    &   The vehicle is running, until the power supply is adjusted down to 6V, where vehicle stops running. &   Yes              \\
\hline%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           6    &   As the steering controller do not work, as the magnetometer do not work in the room with the GoT system, the test could not be performed normally. Instead the vehicle is moved around manually, where the coordinates and the current line is monitored on a computer, which is shown on \figref{}. The figure shows that the route controls sets new line correctly and the requirement should be fulfilled with a working steering controller.  &    No                \\
\hline%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           7    &   As the steering controller do not work, as the magnetometer do not work in the room with the GoT system, the test could not be performed normally. Instead the vehicle is placed with a distance of 1 m away from the route line and then manually moved closer to the line, while the distance controller and error distance is monitored, which is shown on \figref{}. This shows that the controller behaved as planned and the requirement should be fulfilled with a working steering controller.   &   No            \\
