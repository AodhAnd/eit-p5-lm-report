\section{Potential consumer expectations}
Usually, we can think of a few priorities consumers will have when buying a product, whatever it is, and some more specific to technical products.\\
\noindent
Here for instance, the autonomy of the vehicle (both in energy and for the navigation), and the overall cost should be considered. The GoT system itself has a cost (around USD 600.00 for the most basic package) beyond anything a normal customer would probably pay for a lawn mower. But despite that, it appears, at first, to be a good solution for us in terms of accuracy and energy consumption compared to GPS-like systems which are even more expensive for the same level of accuracy. \\\\
\noindent
These are the types of preliminary considerations that will influence this design process for an autonomous lawn mower.
