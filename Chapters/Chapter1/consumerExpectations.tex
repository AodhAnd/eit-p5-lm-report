\section{Consumer Expectations}
Usually, consumers have a few priorities when buying a product, whatever it is, and some more specific for technical products.\\
Here for instance, the autonomy of the vehicle (both in energy and for the navigation), and the overall cost should be considered. The GoT system itself has a cost (around \$ $600.00$ for the most basic package) beyond anything a normal customer would probably pay for a lawn mower. But despite that, it appears, at first, to be a good solution for a basic autonomous lawn mower in terms of accuracy and energy consumption compared to GPS-like systems which are even more expensive for the same level of accuracy. \\\\
These are the types of preliminary considerations that will influence this design process for an autonomous lawn mower.
