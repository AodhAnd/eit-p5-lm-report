\section{The Games on Track (GoT) system}
We were provided with the \emph{Games on Track GT-Position} system as a start to be able to determine the lawn mower's position in space. 
% Add reference to GoT description

\noindent
It is composed of four different parts both hardware and software \cite{GOTWebsitePos} :
\begin{itemize}
	\item A tracked module, which emits ultra-sound waves. It should be placed on the lawn mower itself while taking care, that the emitting cell is not obstructed by anything.
	\item Beacons or receivers, placed around the area the lawn mower will move in. Depending on the terrain, anywhere from 2 (\todo{--Resolved-- is two enough? Answer: It is according to the GoT site (see reference in LaTeX comments)} to more than 20 of these can be used: the more is placed, the more accuracy can be obtained to fight against any ambient noise, or the more space can be monitored.
	\item The central system, which calculates the distance of the tracked module to each beacon, and transmits it to the computer via USB in regular intervals.
	\item The GoT software aggregates the received positions throughout time, and can be used to draw a map of the terrain (the lawn), and to determine the absolute position of the tracked module.
\end{itemize}

GoT was originally designed for train modelling, but it is easily adaptable for any use of position tracking and seems a good choice, at first, for our autonomous lawn mower.
But, why not use a satellite based positioning system ?
