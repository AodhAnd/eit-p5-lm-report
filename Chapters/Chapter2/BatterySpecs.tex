\subsection{Battery Pack Specifications} \label{sssec:BatterySpecs}
In order to power the motor, the servomotor, and all the electronics, an electrical power source is needed. A NiMH battery pack from Ansmann Racing with \si{7,2\ V} nominal voltage and a \si{4700\ mAh} capacity is given with the vehicle \cite{BatteryDS}. The charge voltage cannot go beyond \si{9,0\ V} and should stay above \si{6,0\ V}.

The provided vehicle and battery have been described. Now it is necessary to understand how the GoT system works, to be able to utilize it to track the vehicle.
