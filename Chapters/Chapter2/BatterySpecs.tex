\subsubsection{Battery Pack Specifications} \label{sssec:BatterySpecs}
In order to power the motor, the servomotor and all the electronics, an electrical power source is needed. A NiMH battery pack from Ansmann Racing with \si{7,2\ V} nominal voltage and a \si{4700\ mAh} capacity is given with the vehicle \cite{BatteryDS}. The charge voltage cannot go beyond \si{9,0\ V} and should stay above \si{6,0\ V}.

These are the basic given elements from which the project's prototype is built. However, the functionalities suggested in \secref{sec:UseCase} need to be refined for the prototype implementation.
