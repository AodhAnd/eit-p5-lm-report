\subsection{Drivetrain}
The drivetrain of a motored vehicle, is the components that transfer the rotational energy from the motor to the drive wheel of the vehicle. For this vehicle, the drivetrain will contain the gear connected to the brushed DC motor, the differential gear box and the gears connected to the belts. The drivetrain is illustrated in \figref{vehicleDescriptionDriveTrain}.

The motor delivers a force to the system through a the motor-shaft with a connecting gear. This gear is connected to the start of the drivetrain(1). From there the differential gear box is connected(2). From the differential gears two shafts are connected to a gear which transfers the velocity to the drive wheels(3).
From there the rotational velocity makes the drive-wheel turn, thus rotating the belts which are supported by four free wheels on each side(4). 

The following sections will describe the different parts of the drivetrain seen on \figref {vehicleDescriptionDriveTrain}.\\ \todo{her er Amalie og Niels n√•et til}
