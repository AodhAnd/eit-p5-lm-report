\subsubsection{Servo} \label{Servo}
The vehicle includes a S3003 servomotor from Futaba \cite{futaba}, which is used for the vehicle's steering. The servo can be seen in \figref{FullVehicle}. The way it makes the vehicle turn is by braking the gears on either side of the vehicle, and transferring the velocity over to the other side, by utilization of the differential gearbox.

The servo is controlled by a PWM signal with a period of 30000 \si{\mu s}. By applying a specific PWM signal the servo turns to a certain angle, see \tableref{tab:timeVSangle}. When the arm rotates one way, it triggers the brake on that side, but does not affect the other side.

By convention in this project the neutral position (\si{0^{\circ}}), of the servomotor, is chosen so that the servo-arm is perpendicular to the vehicle's orientation. This ensures that the servo does not push on the brakes. The associated PWM signal of pulse-width is \si{1450\ \mu s}.\\

While these angles are those for the servo tested alone, its combination with the rest of the steering plant adds some limitations to the possible servo orientations.

\subsubsection{Steering's Behavior}\label{sec:SteeringBehavior}
Due to mechanical constraints, the servomotor shall only be used in certain positions. 
Firstly, the servo can not rotate more than a certain amount in each direction due to the two pulling arms, which are attached to either side. Thus, it can never reach the extreme default positions it would if it were not attached.
Secondly, the vehicle's turning is almost negligible and most of all non-linear for small angles of the servo. For these reasons, an offset needs to be applied to jump from the middle position to the edges of the linear areas of steering, see \figref{fig:servoSteeringLinearArea}.
\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{A representation of the servomotor's angle positions. Where the red and blue are the linear steering areas and the green is the neutral position, for the vehicle to go straight}
  \label{fig:servoSteeringLinearArea}
\end{figure}\vspace{-5mm}
The diameters on the circle represent the servo arm which spins around a central position. For example, if the servos arm rotates left, then the left arms pulls back which pushes the brake on the left side, resulting in the vehicle turning left.

The green line, shifted of a few degrees from the \si{0^{\circ}} is the position allowing the vehicle to go straight. Moreover, the actual pulse width value which allows the vehicle to run straight, is not the same that sets the servomotor to its middle position and may slightly vary through time because of mechanical wear.

The linear areas of steering are represented by the red and blue arcs. To turn to the left, the servo angle has to be increased as well as the pulse width. To go to the right, the servo angle has be decreased together with the pulse width.

Still due to mechanical imperfections on the vehicle, the offset that has to be applied to the servo pulse width, to reach the linear area for steering, is different depending on which way the vehicle is turning. It also varies a bit with the ground texture it is running on, because of the friction and it has to be tuned accordingly.
The actual value of this offset is empirically found to be close to \si{\pm 250\ ms}.\\
