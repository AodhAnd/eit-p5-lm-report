The input in the velocity model, $R(s)$, is the vehicle's wanted velocity and the output is the actual velocity of the vehicle. The controller receives an input, $E(s)$, which consist of the wanted speed subtracted with the actual speed measured with a sensor. Hence delivering an error which is to be corrected, to be able to achieve the wanted speed as an output. The controller should therefore deliver a voltage to the Vehicle, $U(s)$, thus, changing the rotational force of the motor and thereby changing the vehicle's velocity. The vehicle is also affected by an external disturbance, $W(s)$, e.g. a slope, wind or ground friction. The vehicles output, $Y(s)$ is the actual velocity of the vehicle. The actual velocity is measured by the sensors and subtracted from the wanted speed.
