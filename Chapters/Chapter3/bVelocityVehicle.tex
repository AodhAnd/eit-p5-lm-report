\section{Velocity Model of the Vehicle}
In this section the \textit{Vehicle} block in \chapref{cha:ModelOfVehicle} \figref{fig:StartTotalModelsystem} is opened up and modelled in respect to the velocity of the vehicle. In \figref{fig:Velocitymodelplantopen} the opening of the \textit{Vehicle} block is illustrated.

The velocity model of the vehicle has been split up into a motor and a drivetrain section. The motor receives an input from the controller, regulating its supplied voltage. In return, the motor delivers a rotational force, as an output to the drivetrain. The drivetrain generates the actual linear velocity as the output of the \textit{Vehicle} block, as well as supplying the motor with an angular velocity which is dependent on the total inertia of the system, and thereby ensures that the motor is affected by its load. The two sections, the motor and the drivetrain, is derived by only considering the parameters affecting the vehicle, when the vehicle is driving in a straight line. Thus, excluding the differential steering and thereby only modelling the system when the wheels have exactly the same velocity.

In the following subsection the motor section in \figref{fig:Velocitymodelplantopen} will be modelled.
