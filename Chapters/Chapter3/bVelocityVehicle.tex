\section{Velocity Model of the Vehicle}
In this section the plant of the velocity model will be derived. The plant is created by only considering the parameters affecting the vehicle, when the vehicle is driving in a straight line. Thus, excluding the differential steering. In \figref{fig:StartTotalModelsystem} a block diagram of the velocity model is illustrated.
