\subsection{Drive Train}\label{DriveTrain}

The drive train on the given belt vehicle is what translates the torque $\tau_m$ given by the motor into the actual movement of the vehicle. The model of this system part shows the relation between the applied rotational force (or torque) $\tau_m$ and the speed of each belt of the vehicle.\\\\

Different iterations of this model can be made to get more and more acuraccy. The first of these iterations should give an overview of how the system reacts to a given torque input. 

\subsubsection{Black Box Model}\label{BlackBoxModel}
To get a rough approximation of how the drive train works, let's consider a black box model where.. [to be continued]
