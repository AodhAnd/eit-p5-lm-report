\subsection{Simulation and Simplified Model}
The previous sections show a velocity model of the system which is modeled in this section. As mentioned in the inertia test, \appref{app:inertiaTest}, the armature inductance is so small that it might not be necessary include for a good simulation. If the armature inductance is nechlectable the system will appear as a first order system instead of a second order, since setting \si{L_a} to zero will remove the second order term. This effect is here shown on the transfer function:
%
\begin{flalign}
  \eq{\frac{V(s)}{U_a(s)}}{ \frac{K_t}{L_a \cdot J_{tot} \cdot s^2 + (R_a \cdot J_{tot} + L_a \cdot B_{tot}) \cdot s + R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e }}\nonumber\\
  &\Downarrow&\nonumber\\
  \eq{\frac{V(s)}{U_a(s)}}{ \frac{ K_t }{ R_a \cdot J_{tot}  \cdot s + R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e }}\nonumber\\
  \eq{\frac{V(s)}{U_a(s)}}{ \frac{ \frac{K_t}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t\cdot K_e} }{ \frac{R_a \cdot J_{tot}}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e}\cdot s + 1 }}
  \label{eq:simplifiedTransferVel}
\end{flalign}
%
By inspection of this this first order expression in \eqref{eq:simplifiedTransferVel} the terms for the time constant and the gain are extracted:
\begin{flalign}
  \eq{K}{\frac{K_t}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t\cdot K_e}}&\nonumber\\
  \eq{\tau }{ \frac{R_a \cdot J}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e} }\nonumber&
\end{flalign}
%
The model is approximated based on this gain and time constant. To verify that this is a viable approximation, the following simplified model, \figref{fig:BlockDiagramDrivetrainSimplified},is created:

\end{figure}
%
Where \si{K} is the gain of the system and \si{\tau} is the time constant. This simple first order model of the system is simulated alongside the second order model to verify that the vehicle can indeed be handled as a first order system. The plot of the two simulations are shown on \figref{fig:ComparisonOf1stAnd2ndOrderModels}.

In the following section this first order model is verified directly by comparison with recorded data of the vehicle's step response.
