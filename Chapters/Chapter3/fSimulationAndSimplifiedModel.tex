\subsection{Simulation and Simplified Model}
The previous sections show a velocity model of the system which is modelled in this section. As mentioned in the inertia test, \appref{app:inertiaTest}, the armature inductance is so small that it is not necessary to include for a good simulation. If the armature inductance is neglectable, and removed, the system will appear as a first order system instead of a second order. Therefore \si{L_a} is set to zero and hence removing the second order term. This effect is illustrated in the transfer function:
%
\begin{flalign}
  \eq{\frac{V(s)}{U_a(s)}}{ \frac{K_t}{L_a \cdot J_{tot} \cdot s^2 + (R_a \cdot J_{tot} + L_a \cdot B_{tot}) \cdot s + R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e }}\nonumber\\
  &\Downarrow&\nonumber\\
  \eq{\frac{V(s)}{U_a(s)}}{ \frac{ K_t }{ R_a \cdot J_{tot}  \cdot s + R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e }}\nonumber\\
  \eq{\frac{V(s)}{U_a(s)}}{ \frac{ \frac{K_t}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t\cdot K_e} }{ \frac{R_a \cdot J_{tot}}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e}\cdot s + 1 }}
  \label{eq:simplifiedTransferVel}
\end{flalign}
%
By inspection of the first order expression, in \eqref{eq:simplifiedTransferVel}, the terms for the time constant and the gain are extracted:
\begin{flalign}
  \eq{K}{\frac{K_t}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t\cdot K_e}}&\nonumber\\
  \eq{\tau }{ \frac{R_a \cdot J}{R_a \cdot B_{tot} + K_t \cdot K_e} }\nonumber&
\end{flalign}
%
To verify that this is a viable approximation, the following simplified model, in \figref{fig:BlockDiagramDrivetrainSimplified}, is created:
%

	\includegraphics[scale = .5]{figures/totalVelocityModelDiagramSimplified.pdf}
	\caption{A block diagram showing a simplified model}
	\label{fig:BlockDiagramDrivetrainSimplified}
\end{figure}
%
Where \si{K} is the gain of the system and \si{\tau} is the time constant. This simplified first order model of the system is simulated alongside the second order model, to verify that the vehicle can indeed be handled as a first order system. The plot of the two simulations are illustrated in \figref{fig:ComparisonOf1stAnd2ndOrderModels}.
%
From this figure it is impossible to see any difference between the two models, however, zooming in on the base of the step, see \figref{fig:comparison1stAnd2ndOrderModelsZoom}, the difference becomes clear.

  	\hspace{0.03\linewidth}

    	\end{figure}
  	\end{minipage}
  \end{minipage}

However, a quick glance at the axes shows how minimal the impact of this difference must be. An other and possibly clearer way to show the difference of the two models, is through use of Bode plots. A Bode plot of the two models imposed on one another is seen on \figref{fig:bodePlotOf1stAnd2ndOrderModel}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.1 \textwidth]{figures/bodePlotOf1stAnd2ndOrderModel.png}
	\caption{Bode plot showing the differences between the \si{1^{st}} and \si{2^{nd}} order models}
	\label{fig:bodePlotOf1stAnd2ndOrderModel}
\end{figure}
%
For frequencies below 1000 \si{rad\cdot s^{-1}} the two models are very similar because each of their first poles are very close; in 3,8759 \si{rad\cdot s^{-1}} for the \si{1^{st}} order model and 3,9 \si{rad\cdot s^{-1}} for the \si{2^{nd}} order model. The \si{2^{nd}} order model however has an other pole which causes the phase shift and shift in magnitude at higher frequencies. However since this pole is so high, 1489,5 \si{rad\cdot s^{-1}}, it does not affect the lower pole considerably and the differences are way beyond significant frequency range.

Now the model is approximated with a first order model using a certain gain and time constant, deduced from the second order model. The parameters for this has been determined through a series of smaller tests, however determining the gain and time constant can also be done through testing of the system in its entity. Such tests are carried out and can be found in \appref{app:gainTest} and \appref{app:inertiaTest}, where the gain and time constant is found.
The two approaches gives slightly different results when simulating, as seen on \figref{fig:ComparingFirstOrderModels}. For both simulations a disturbance, sticktion, is added to the output. For the model parameters determined through the 2nd order model, sticktion is not accounted for. It is however accounted for when measuring the gain and time constant through testing of the entire vehicle. This is the reason of the offset between the two simulations. It also causes the negative offset for both simulations.

In the rest of the report the holistically measured gain and time constant is used in simulation of the plant as a first order system. In the following section this simplified model is verified directly by comparison with recorded data of the vehicle's step response.
