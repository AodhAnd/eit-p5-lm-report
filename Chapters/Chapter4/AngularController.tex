\subsection{Angular controller}
The purpose of the angular controller is to have the vehicle turn according to a reference, that the controller gets from the route planning. As the steering only have a little linear area (See \appref{app:LinearAreaKp}), the types of controller that can be used is very limited. A controller type that can be used is a proportional controller.

\subsubsection{Proportional controller}

  \label{fig:PconAngpic}
\end{figure}

On \figref{fig:PconAngpic}, there is implemented a proportional controller into the model for the angular steering model, from \secref{sec:SteeringModel}. This will give the following closed loop transfer function:

\begin{flalign}
  \eq{ \frac{\theta_{actual}}{\theta_{wanted}} }{ \frac{\frac{ K_p \cdot K_v \cdot K_s }{ (\lambda \cdot s + 1) \cdot s } }{ \frac{ K_p \cdot K_v \cdot K_s }{ (\lambda \cdot s + 1) \cdot s } + 1} }&\label{eq:PconAng}
\end{flalign}

According to \appref{app:steeringGainTest}, the product of $K_v$ and $K_s$, called $K_{steering}$, is equal to:

\begin{flalign}
\eq{K_{steering}}{0,5149 \cdot v - 0,1925}
\end{flalign}

As $v$ is the wanted velocity, which is 1,4 $m \cdot s^{-1}$, $K_{steering}$ is equal to 0,386. And with lambda equal to the servo duty cycle time constant on 30 ms, the transfer function will be:

\begin{flalign}
  \eq{ \frac{\theta_{actual}}{\theta_{wanted}} }{ \frac{\frac{ K_p \cdot 0,386 }{ (0,03 \cdot s + 1) \cdot s } }{ \frac{ K_p \cdot 0,386 }{ (0,03 \cdot s + 1) \cdot s } + 1} }&\label{eq:PconAng2}
\end{flalign}

This is converted to the standard form:

\begin{flalign}
  \eq{ \frac{\theta_{actual}}{\theta_{wanted}} }{ \frac{1}{\frac{ 0,03 \cdot s^2 + s }{ K_p \cdot 0,386 } + 1} }&\label{eq:PconAng3}
\end{flalign}

According to \appref{app:LinearAreaKp}, the system with a proportional controller is only linear within the range of a $K_p$ on 1,5 to 3. To get smallest possible time constant, the $K_p$ need to be as big as possible. Therefore the $K_p$ is set to 3, which give:

\begin{flalign}
  \eq{ \frac{\theta_{actual}}{\theta_{wanted}} }{ \frac{1}{\frac{ 0,03 \cdot s^2 + s }{ 3 \cdot 0,386 } + 1} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{ 0,026 \cdot s^2 + 0,86 \cdot s + 1} }&\label{eq:PconAng4}
\end{flalign}

From this transfer function, it can be seen that the gain is equal to one and the system is a second order system. The reason that the proportional controller here give a gain equal to 1 and the proportional controller for the velocity does not, is that there is a integrator in this system, that removes this steady state error. This way, a proportional controller will be good enough to handle the controlling of the angular movement of the vehicle.
