\section{Steering Controller}\label{sec:steeringController}
The steering controller is being split up in two controllers. One to control the angular movement of the vehicle, with the use of the servo and magnetometer, so the car can follow the right direction and another controller to keep the vehicle on the route, using the GoT system. Both controller will be design out from the steering model from \secref{sec:SteeringModel}. 

A problem, that have occur, is that the magnetometer do not work inside, which makes testing with both the GoT system and magnetometer together impossible, as the GoT system is located indoor. This problem effects the testing of some parts of the system, which will only be simulated.

As the angular controller works on the first part of the plant, it will be design first.

\subsection{Route control}
The steering controllers uses information from the route, which it have to follow. The route is made up by a number of points in the coordinate system from the GoT system, with drawn lines between, illustrated in \figref{fig:RCfig1}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsubsection{Angle}
The directional controller needs the angle of the route line, that is added to the output from the distance controller, to be the reference angle for the controller. The lines is made by connection the points from the route and therefore only the start and end point of each line is known. To calculate the angle of the line, compared to the coordinate system of the GoT system, \eqref{eq:RCeq1} is used.
%
\begin{flalign}
  \eq{\theta_{line}}{tan^{-1}\left(\frac{Y_{end}-Y_{start}}{X_{end}-X_{start}}\right) \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}}\unit{\si{^\circ}}\label{eq:RCeq1}
\end{flalign}
%
As the output from the inverse tangent is in $rad \cdot s^{-1}$, it is multiple by $\frac{180}{\pi}$ to convert it to degrees. With this equation, zero degrees will be in the direction of the positive x axis and it will go counter clockwise for positive angles and clockwise for negative angles. This gives a range from \si{-180^\circ} to \si{180^\circ}, which also is the output from the magnetometer. If compared, the angle from the coordinate system for the GoT system is not equal to the angle, that comes from the magnetometer. The reason for this is that the positive x axis is not going in the same direction as north. Therefore an offset angle is needed, which rotates the coordinate system, so zero degrees for the coordinate system and the magnetometer is the same direction.

There will be a mathematical problem, if the X coordinates is the same for both points, as there will be divided by zero. If the X values is the same, the angle will be either 90 degrees, if going toward positive y axis, or -90 degrees, if going the opposite way. As the difference can be seen on the difference in the Y value, the function will return the right numbers, even if is should not be mathematically possible to calculate it.

As the magnetometer do not work in the GoT room, this offset angle cannot be measured and therefore the right angle of the line cannot be calculated and used for indoor test.

\subsubsection{Distance}
The distance controller needs the distance from the vehicle to the route line, as it utilizes this value as a error value. The distance can be calculated with \eqref{eq:RCeq2}.

\begin{flalign}
  \eq{Distance}{\frac{(a \cdot X_{now}) + (b \cdot Y_{now}) + c)  }{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}}\unit{m}\label{eq:RCeq2}
\end{flalign}
%
\begin{figure}[H]
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/DistanceOutLoop}
 	\caption{Illustration of the distance, that is calculated. The line, that comes from the shortest distance, is orthogonal on the route line.}
 	\label{fig:RCfig2}
\end{figure}\vspace{-5mm}

\eqref{eq:RCeq2} is a standard vector equation to calculate the shortest distance from a point to a line (See \figref{RCfig2}). The a, b and c values can be calculated from the start and end point, by using \eqref{eq:RCeq3}, \eqref{eq:RCeq4} and \eqref{eq:RCeq5}.

\begin{flalign}
  \eq{a}{Y_{end} - Y_{start}}\unit{m}\label{eq:RCeq3} \\
  \eq{b}{X_{start} - X_{end}}\unit{m}\label{eq:RCeq4} \\
  \eq{c}{X_{end} \cdot Y_{start} - Y_{end} \cdot X_{start}}\unit{m}\label{eq:RCeq5}
\end{flalign}

From \eqref{eq:RCeq2}, the distance is calculated. If the distance is negative, the vehicle is on the left side of the line and on the right side, when the distance i positive. With this equation and the measured coordinate from the GoT system, the distance the vehicle is away from the line is known and can be used as a error in the distance controller.

\subsubsection{New line}
When the vehicle reach the end point of a line on the route, a new line is used to calculate the angle and distance. The new line's start point will be the last line's end point, so the route lines is connected. Then the next end point is set and the angle can be calculated and the distance measured.

As the GoT system have a precision down to 1 mm, the coordinates too have a precision of 1 mm \secref{sec:Vehicledescription}. The vehicle will not hit the end point with this precision, as the GOT system only delivers a measurement each 100 ms, and if the vehicle travels with 1,4 $m \cdot s^{-1}$, it will travel 140 mm for each measurement, which make the chance for hitting the end point exactly, small. Therefore is the area, which indicates the end of the route line, made bigger. The size should be around twice as big as the distance, which the vehicle travels between each measurement. With this size, there will always be two measurement in the circle, so even if one of the measurements is not good, there will be another one. This will give a circle with a radius of 28 cm

Controllers for the two models, velocity and steering, have been designed and tested. It is now possible to design a filter for the directional controller of the steering, to see if improvements on the angular sensors measurements is obtainable.
