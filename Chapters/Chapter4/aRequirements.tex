\chapter{Prototype Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
%\item \textbf{It shall be possible to track the vehicle's position}
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\item[] why and from where?
%	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{There must be a one-way wireless communication from the GoT system to the vehicle}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] The vehicle needs to receive its own location by wireless communication, and thereby make it possible for the vehicle to change it's direction, if necessary, and drive without cables, see \secref{Finalprototype}.
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{It shall be possible for the prototype to disregard incorrect packets sent from the GoT system}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] why and from where?
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The prototype must be able to disregard erroneous coordinates sent from the GoT system}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Ensures that if the GoT system delivers an unrealistic coordinate, e.g. created by noise, to the vehicle, it is disregarded, see \secref{Finalprototype}.
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{The prototype must be able to access the route, which it has to follow, from a storage space located on the prototype}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] why and from where?
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{The prototype must be able to measure the voltage on it's battery}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] why and from where?
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{It shall be possible for the prototype to follow a predetermined route within the edge map}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] why and from where?
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{It shall be possible for the prototype to return to the predetermined route if disturbed}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] why and from where?
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{The prototype shall be able to keep a predetermined velocity when going up - or downhill}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] why and from where?
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
