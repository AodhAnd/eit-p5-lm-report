\chapter{Control of the Vehicle}\label{cha:ControlOfTheVehicle}
With both the velocity and steering model established, controllers can be designed for the vehicle to become autonomous.\\
The first controller to be made in this chapter is on the velocity system to allow the vehicle to run at steady speeds. It will then be possible to control the steering, first to get the vehicle going in the wanted direction and finally to have it following a predefined route.
