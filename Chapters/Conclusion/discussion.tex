\chapter{Discussion}
In the following chapter, the design of the prototype will be discussed, about the improvements to the prototype, to fulfilled the requirements and further improvements to a final product, that can be used in the real world.

The distance controller, and therefore the whole steering controller, did not get tested, as the magnetometer do not work inside the GoT room. This made the two requirements for the steering not testable. By taking the GoT system outside, where the magnetometer works, and calibrate the system, the test can be made. As the position system when used also should be placed outside, the system for the final product should be able to set up outside.

The last requirement, that was not fulfilled, was the requirement about the storage.
