# Electronics and IT - 5th semester project report (2015)
Report for our Electronics and IT 5th semester student project at Aalborg University (AAU)

This report can be of help for people willing to learn basics of system modelling and automation, signal processing or communication in the context of an applied (but simple) project. It is written as if we were designing a lawn mower's trajectory control.

Main project material can be found [here](https://github.com/AodhAnd/eit-p5-lm-main)

/!\ Disclaimer: please be reminded that this is a scholar project. As such, it is mainly aimed at proving that team members were able to apply knowledge from various courses we had at the university and with tools and material that were available to us.
We are not responsible for anything that could happen, this is just our will to share knowledge we have gained from our experience and gathered in a (not so short) report.
