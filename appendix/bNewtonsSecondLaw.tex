% DEFINITION OF NEWTON'S PRINCIPLE %
Newton's second law is the main formula to use for mechanical models of a system. It can be written as :

\begin{flalign}\centering
M \cdot a = \sum F_{ext}
\label{eq:mechanicalmodel}
\end{flalign}
\hspace{6mm} Where:\\
\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}ll}
& $M$             & is the system's mass [$kg$] \\
& $a = \dot v$    & is the linear acceleration of the system [$m \cdot s^{-2}$] \\
& $v$             & is the linear velocity of the system [$m \cdot s^{-1}$] \\
& $\sum F_{ext}$  & is the sum of external forces applied to the system [$N$] \\
\end{tabular},

which can also be applied to rotational systems as :
\begin{flalign}\centering
J \cdot \alpha = \sum \tau_{ext}
\label{eq:mechanicalmodel}
\end{flalign}
\hspace{6mm} Where:\\
\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}ll}
& $J$                     & is the system's inertia [$kg \cdot m^2$] \\
& $\alpha = \dot{\omega}$ & is the rotational acceleration of the system [$rad \cdot s^{-2}$] \\
& $\omega$                & is the rotational velocity of the system [$rad \cdot s^{-1}$] \\
& $\sum \tau_{ext}$       & is the sum of external torques applied to the system [$N \cdot m$] \\
\end{tabular}.
