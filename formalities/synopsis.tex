In order to facilitate the lawn mowing, robotic lawn mowers have been pushed to the market the last few years.\\
From a given vehicle base, this project intends to improve the easiness of use and reduce installation constraints by use of ultrasound positioning and wireless communication.\\
Models of this vehicle have been built, upstream from the design and implementation of appropriate controllers to actually make the vehicle autonomous. The prototype is implemented with a positioning system which communicates with an Arduino platform running an open-source kernel. Feedback is fed to the controllers from angular and velocity sensors for which filtering has been considered.\\
Except from one functionality which could not be tested in practice due to one sensor incompatibility with indoor environment. The different parts of the system have been simulated through software and have been proven to work successfully in real life.
